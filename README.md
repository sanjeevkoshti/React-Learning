# React Basics (Minimal)

A minimal React + Vite setup with boilerplate removed for a clean starting point.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code.
  - `main.jsx`: Entry point for the React application.
  - `App.jsx`: Main application component.
  - `App.css` & `index.css`: Styling files (currently cleared).
- `public/`: Static assets that are copied to the build folder.
- `dist/`: The output folder when the project is built for production (`npm run build`). Do not edit files here directly.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for Production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
